# 🐬 HappyWhales 🐋

### 🎆️ Our Mission
Currently, most research institutions rely on time-intensive—and sometimes inaccurate—manual identification of dolphins and whales by the human eye. Thousands of hours go into manual matching.

With this project, we aim to develop a model to match individual whales and dolphins by their unique natural markings on their dorsal fins and lateral body views.


### 🌞 Our group
We are 5 Bachelors Computer Science students from the Vrije Universiteit based in the Netherlands.

### 🌍 Our Impact
With our fast and accurate photo-ID suggestions, we give conservation researchers more time to focus on other important parts in their research, helping them understand and manage the impact on the world's changing oceans.
